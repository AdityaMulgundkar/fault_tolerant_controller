## Minutes of meetings

### 13th January, Thursday

- Aditya, Mayank to setup Git together
- Mayank showed Aditya's dronekit motor fault simulation code
- Aditya to generate motor fault data-set
    - IIT-D will run in parallel to this, later
    - To generate fault data for 1 or 2 motor combinations (on both quad and hexa)
    - IIT-D also simultaneously working on EKF algorithm for fault detection
- Srikanth, Avijit are testing quadrotor now
    - Some RPM difference issue in motors as of now
    - Hari sir asked to try to complete/run quadcopter by next week

### 20th January, Thursday

- Aditya to generate data set for Plus Quadcopter; with a few minor changes/additions

Hari sir:
- Check timestamp on dataset, instead of actual/real time, it should be relative timestamp to the simulation
- Set timestamp update frequency manually at run-time
- Can also set the copter design variables - mass, thrust per motor, etc
    - This is available in dronekit-sitl/dronekit_sitl/pysim/multicopter.py

### 27th January, Thursday

- Aditya presented dataset sample for different vehicle model - DJI F450
- Hari sir asked not to change or focus on different vehicles since the models would more or less be the same
- Aditya to update and send dataset by EoW
